Year-over-Year YTD Sales (YoYTD)
This measure calculates the absolute delta between current YTD and prior YTD sales, making it possible to track year-to-year momentum up to the same point in time.

Measure Definition

YOYTD Sales :=
VAR current_YTD_Sales = [Sales YTD (Simple) Angel]
VAR previous_YTD_Sales = [PYTD Sales]
VAR results =
    IF(
        AND(
            NOT ISBLANK(current_YTD_Sales),
            NOT ISBLANK(previous_YTD_Sales)
        ),
        current_YTD_Sales - previous_YTD_Sales
    )
RETURN
    results

Behavior
Returns the delta between current and prior YTD sales
Avoids returning misleading numbers when either side is missing (BLANK() safe)
Requires proper definition of both [Sales YTD (Simple) Angel] and [PYTD Sales] (both should include cutoff logic via [ShowValueForDates])

Dependencies
You must define:
[Sales YTD (Simple) Angel]:

CALCULATE([Sales Amount], DATESYTD('Date'[Date]))
[PYTD Sales]:

IF([ShowValueForDates],
 CALCULATE([Sales YTD (Simple) Angel],
     DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR))
)
And a supporting cutoff control like:

ShowValueForDates :=
VAR max_date = CALCULATE(MAX('Date'[Date]), REMOVEFILTERS())
VAR min_date = MIN('Date'[Date])
RETURN min_date <= max_date

Thank you :)
