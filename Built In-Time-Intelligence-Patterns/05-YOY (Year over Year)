This measure calculates the absolute change in sales between the current period and the same period in the previous year (PY). It is a foundational metric for analyzing business growth or decline over time.
Use the PY Sales Pattern section to get the correct Previous Year sales number:

Compare sales for the current period to the same period last year, returning the raw difference in value.

Measure Definition

YOY Sales :=
VAR current_period = [Sales Amount]
VAR previous_period = [PY Sales]
VAR result =
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_period) && NOT ISBLANK(previous_period),
        current_period - previous_period
    )
RETURN
    result
Behavior
If both current and previous period values exist, it returns the delta:

Current - Previous

If either value is blank (e.g., no sales), it returns BLANK() to avoid misleading output

This works for:
Daily, monthly, quarterly, or yearly contexts
Any granularity supported by your Date table
