Fiscal Prior Year Calendar (Fiscal PYC) Sales
This measure calculates sales for the entire previous fiscal year, based on a custom fiscal year-end (in this case, June 30). 
It allows clean full-year-over-full-year comparisons when the business doesn’t operate on a Jan–Dec calendar.

DAX Measure
Fiscal PYC Sales :=
IF(
    [ShowValueForDates],
    CALCULATE(
        [Sales Amount],
        PREVIOUSYEAR('Date'[Date], "06-30")
    )
)

How It Works
PREVIOUSYEAR('Date'[Date], "06-30") returns all dates in the previous fiscal year, ending June 30.

If today is July 15, 2024 → This will pull from July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2023

CALCULATE([Sales Amount], ...) evaluates total sales during that prior fiscal year window

IF([ShowValueForDates], …) ensures nothing is evaluated past the latest known sales date

Comparison of Time Functions
Function	Returns
PREVIOUSYEAR('Date'[Date])	Calendar: Jan 1–Dec 31 of prior year
PREVIOUSYEAR('Date'[Date], "06-30")	Fiscal: Jul 1–Jun 30 of prior fiscal year
PARALLELPERIOD(..., -1, YEAR)	Full period back (ignores fiscal context)

Use Cases
Comparing this fiscal year vs last fiscal year
Dashboards where business runs on non-calendar year
Executive or financial summary views requiring total prior-year benchmarks

Supporting Measures
Make sure you’ve already defined:

ShowValueForDates :=
VAR max_date =
    CALCULATE(MAX('Sales'[Order Date]), REMOVEFILTERS())
VAR current_context_date = MIN('Date'[Date])
RETURN
    current_context_date <= max_date
And optionally:

Fiscal YTD Sales :=
IF(
    [ShowValueForDates],
    CALCULATE([Sales Amount], DATESYTD('Date'[Date], "06-30"))
)

Thank you :)
