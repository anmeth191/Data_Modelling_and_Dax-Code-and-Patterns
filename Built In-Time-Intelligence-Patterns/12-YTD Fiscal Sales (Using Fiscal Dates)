Fiscal Year-To-Date (FYTD) Sales
This measure calculates Year-To-Date sales based on a custom fiscal year end, not the default December 31st.
It ensures that your time intelligence aligns with business calendars — such as July–June or April–March fiscal years.

DAX Measure

Fiscal YTD Sales :=
IF(
    [ShowValueForDates],
    CALCULATE(
        [Sales Amount],
        DATESYTD('Date'[Date], "06-30")
    )
)

What It Does
DATESYTD('Date'[Date], "06-30") tells DAX:
"My fiscal year ends on June 30th", so:

July 1st starts the new fiscal year

June 30th ends it

CALCULATE([Sales Amount], DATESYTD(...)) scopes the sales to just those dates within the current fiscal year up to the current date

[ShowValueForDates] guards against miscalculations past your last valid sales date

Use Cases
Businesses whose financial calendars don’t align with Jan–Dec
Quarterly reports where fiscal quarters don’t match calendar quarters
Organizations that plan, budget, or bonus based on fiscal results

Tips & Best Practices
The "MM-DD" string in DATESYTD must match the fiscal year end date, not the start

Safeguard Measure
Still use this with [ShowValueForDates] or [DateWithSales] to prevent misleading values past your actual data range.
ShowValueForDates = 
var max_date_with_sales = CALCULATE( 
                                   MAX('Sales'[Order Date]), 
                                         REMOVEFILTERS())
var current_filter_context_date = MIN('Date'[Date])
return 
current_filter_context_date <= max_date_with_sales

Thank you :)
