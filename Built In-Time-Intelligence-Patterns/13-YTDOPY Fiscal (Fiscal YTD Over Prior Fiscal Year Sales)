 Fiscal YTD Over Prior Fiscal Year (Fiscal YTDOPY) Sales
This measure compares the current Fiscal Year-To-Date (FYTD) sales against the entire prior fiscal year, giving an early view of how the current year is pacing vs last year.

DAX Measure

Fiscal YTDOPY Sales :=
VAR current_fiscal_year = [Fiscal YTD Sales]
VAR previous_fy = [Fiscal PYC Sales]
RETURN
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_fiscal_year) &&
        NOT ISBLANK(previous_fy),
        current_fiscal_year - previous_fy
    )

What It Does
[Fiscal YTD Sales] → current sales up to today in the fiscal year (e.g., Jul 1 – today)
[Fiscal PYC Sales] → entire previous fiscal year (e.g., Jul 1 last year – Jun 30 this year)

Returns the delta between both
This is a trend pacing metric:
"How far along are we this fiscal year compared to last year's total?"

Business Caveat
This is not apples-to-apples unless you're at or near fiscal year-end.

If you're in Q1 of the fiscal year:
The current YTD is low
The prior year total is complete
Result will be negative until you catch up

This is expected and used to gauge run-rate or performance pacing

Example
Current Date	Fiscal YTD Sales	Fiscal PYC Sales	YTDOPY
Sep 30	$1,000,000	$4,200,000	-$3,200,000
Jan 15	$2,750,000	$4,200,000	-$1,450,000
Jun 30	$4,300,000	$4,200,000	$100,000

Use Cases
Performance pacing: "Are we on track to beat last year?"
High-level dashboards for execs and CFOs
Alerts when YTD is behind prior full year by too much
