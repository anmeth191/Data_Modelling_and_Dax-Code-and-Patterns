This documentation outlines variations for calculating Prior Quarter Sales (PQ Sales) in DAX.
The goal is to compare current-period performance with the equivalent period in the previous quarter, 
while ensuring that comparisons stop at the last known sales date to avoid misleading partial-to-full period analysis.

legacy measure:
showValueswithsales =
var max_date_with_sales = CALCULATE(MAX('sales_order'[order_date]) , REMOVEFILTERS())
current_filter_context_date = min('Date'[Date])
return
current_filter_context_date <= max_date_with_sales

This returns FALSE for dates after the last recorded sale, preventing any downstream calculations from being evaluated past that point.

Variation 1: Using DATEADD (manual offset)

PQ_Sales = 
IF
(
showValueswithsales , 
CALCULATE( [Sales_amount], CALCULATETABLE( DATEADD('Date'[Date]) , -1 ,  QUARTER ),  date_with_sales = TRUE)
)

Shifts the current filter context back by one quarter
Limits comparison to prior-quarter dates where sales actually occurred
Respects the [ShowValuesWithSales] cutoff to avoid future-looking valuesShifts the current filter context back by one quarter
Limits comparison to prior-quarter dates where sales actually occurred

IMPORTANT !!!!!

Why PREVIOUSQUARTER() is Not Recommended Here
PREVIOUSQUARTER() returns the entire previous quarter, regardless of the current context.

Example:

Current context: August 1–15 (partial month of Q3)
PREVIOUSQUARTER() → April 1–June 30 (full Q2)
This leads to unfair comparisons of a partial period to a full quarter
Use DATEADD(..., -1, QUARTER) instead, which respects the shape of the current time window.

Thank you :)
