Prior Quarter-To-Date (PQTD) Sales
This measure calculates Quarter-To-Date sales from the previous quarter, aligned to the shape of the current quarter-to-date in the filter context. 
It ensures the comparison is fair and avoids extending beyond the last available date with sales.

Measure Definition

PQTD Sales :=
VAR dates_table =
    CALCULATETABLE(
        DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, QUARTER),
        'Date'[DateWithSales] = TRUE
    )
RETURN
    IF(
        [ShowValueForDates],
        CALCULATE([QTD Sales], dates_table)
    )

How It Works

DATEADD(..., -1, QUARTER) shifts the current context's date range back one quarter
CALCULATETABLE(..., 'Date'[DateWithSales] = TRUE) ensures only dates with sales are used (avoids inflating prior quarter results)
[ShowValueForDates] ensures the measure stops calculating once you're beyond the last available transaction date

Prerequisites
You need:
A well-marked Date table

DateWithSales Calculated Column:
DateWithSales := 'Date'[Date] <= MAX('Sales'[Sales Order])

A [QTD Sales] measure like:
QTD Sales :=
CALCULATE([Sales Amount], DATESQTD('Date'[Date]))

A reliable cutoff control like:
ShowValueForDates :=
VAR max_date = CALCULATE(MAX('Date'[Date]), REMOVEFILTERS())
VAR min_date = MIN('Date'[Date])
RETURN
    min_date <= max_date

This keeps comparisons fair — same day position in each quarter.

Use Cases
Quarter-to-date comparisons in dashboards
Executive KPIs like:
“How does Q3 so far compare to Q2?”
“Are we ahead of pace this quarter vs. last?”

Works great in combo with:
QoQ Delta
PQ Sales
Rolling QTD logic
