Previous Month Sales (PM Sales) with Cutoff Logic
This pattern calculates sales for the previous month, ensuring that the comparison only includes periods where actual sales data exists, 
and respects the last date of available data to avoid misleading visuals.

Dependencies

Ensure you have:
[Sales Amount] measure -> SUM(Sales'SalesAmount')
[DateWithSales] boolean column in your Date table -> Calculated column where 'Date'[Date] <= MAX('Sales'[Order_date])
[ShowValueForDates] cutoff logic -> var max_order_date_sales = calculate(MAX('Sales'[Order_date]) , removefilters()) 
                                     var min_date_current_filter = MIN('Date'[Date])
                                        return 
                                             min_date_current_filter <= max_order_date_sales 
                                               //This will return TRUE or FALSE

Measure Definition
PM Month Sales :=
VAR define_date_table =
    CALCULATETABLE(
        DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, MONTH),
        'Date'[DateWithSales] = TRUE
    )
RETURN
    IF(
        [ShowValueForDates],
        CALCULATE(
            [Sales Amount],
            define_date_table
        )
    )

Behavior
Shifts the current filter context back by one month
Filters the resulting date range to include only dates with valid sales
Prevents evaluation past the last available sales date using [ShowValueForDates]

Best Practice
Avoid using plain PREVIOUSMONTH() unless you're certain that:
The current month is complete
The calendar structure is regular
Youâ€™re okay comparing full months blindly

DATEADD(..., -1, MONTH) gives you context-aligned, partial-period-aware comparisons.

Now you can use it to calculate Month Over Month:

This DAX measure calculates the absolute change in sales between the current month and the previous month.
It builds on the [PM Month Sales] (Previous Month Sales) pattern, which includes cutoff logic to ensure accurate comparisons.

Measure Definition

MoM Sales :=
VAR current_month = [Sales Amount]
VAR month_previous = [PM Month Sales]
VAR results =
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_month) && NOT ISBLANK(month_previous),
        current_month - month_previous
    )
RETURN
    results

Returns the difference in sales between the current and previous month
Avoids showing misleading deltas by returning BLANK() if either month is missing
Works cleanly with partial-month logic if [PM Month Sales] uses DATEADD and [ShowValuesWithSales]

Thank you :)
