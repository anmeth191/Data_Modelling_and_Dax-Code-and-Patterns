Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) Sales â€“ Absolute Change
This measure calculates the absolute difference in sales between the current quarter (or partial quarter) and the previous quarter, 
using a properly filtered prior-quarter measure ([PQ Sales]).

Measure Definition

QoQ Sales :=
VAR sales = [Sales Amount]
VAR previous_pq = [PQ Sales]
VAR result =
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(sales) && NOT ISBLANK(previous_pq),
        sales - previous_pq
    )
RETURN
    result

Behavior
Returns the raw delta between current and prior quarter sales
Avoids misleading output by returning blank if either value is missing
Works with partial periods if [PQ Sales] was defined using the DATEADD pattern with cutoff logic
