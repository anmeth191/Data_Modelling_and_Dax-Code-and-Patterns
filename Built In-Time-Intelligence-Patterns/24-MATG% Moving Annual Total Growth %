This measure returns the percentage growth of sales over a trailing 12-month window, compared to the same rolling window one year earlier.

Measure Code
MATG % Sales :=
DIVIDE(
    [MATG Sales],
    [PYMAT Sales]
)

How it Works
[MATG Sales] gives you the absolute change between this year’s MAT and the prior year’s MAT.
[PYMAT Sales] provides the base value for comparison.
DIVIDE() handles safe division, returning blank if denominator is zero (instead of an error).

Business Value
This is the KPI that stakeholders care about:
“Are we up or down vs. last year?”
“By what percentage?”

It allows clear reporting of rolling year-over-year growth, avoiding distortions from partial periods or calendar-year resets.

Dependencies
[Sales MAT] – Current 12-month rolling total
CALCULATE([Sales Amount] , DATEINPERIOD(Date[Date] , MAX(Date[Date]) , -12 , MONTH ))

[PYMAT Sales] – Prior year rolling total
CALCULATE([Sales MAT] , DATEADD(Date[Date] , -12 , MONTH ))

[MATG Sales] – Absolute difference between the two
var current_MAT = [Sales MAT]
var previousYear_MAT = [PYMAT Sales] 
var result = IF(NOT ISBLANK(current_MAT) && NOT ISBLANK(previousYear_MAT) , current_MAT - previousYear_MAT) 

Thank you :)
