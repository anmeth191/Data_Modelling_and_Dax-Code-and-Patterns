This measure calculates Quarter-To-Date sales manually, using Year Month Number and Year Quarter Number keys instead of relying on DAX’s built-in TOTALQTD or other time intelligence.
This pattern works for both standard and fiscal quarters, provided the Date table has the required columns.

Note: Date table must be integrated and have Year Month Number and Year Quarter Number columns.

Code:

QTD Sales = 
// Get the highest Year Month Number visible in the current filter context
// Example: If the visual is showing up to May 2007, this returns 200705
VAR current_year_month_number = MAX('Date'[Year Month Number])

// Get the highest Year Quarter Number in the current filter context
// Example: If we are in Q2 2007, this could be 20072 (depending on your table’s coding format)
VAR current_qtd = MAX('Date'[Year Quarter Number])

// Calculate sales for all months from the start of the quarter up to the current month
VAR result =
    CALCULATE(
        Sales[Sales Amount],

        // Remove existing filters on the Date table to take full control of the filter context
           //Using ALL('Date') produces the same effect
        REMOVEFILTERS('Date'),

        // Include only months that are less than or equal to the current month in context
        // This ensures we only sum from the start of the quarter up to the selected month
        'Date'[Year Month Number] <= current_year_month_number,

        // Ensure all dates are in the same quarter as the current context
        'Date'[Year Quarter Number] = current_qtd
    )

RETURN
    result

Example in action:
If the current filter context is May 2007 (Q2 2007):
Year Quarter Number → 20072
Year Month Numbers included → 200704 (Apr) and 200705 (May)
This returns sales for April + May 2007.

If the current filter context is July 2007 (Q3 2007):

Year Quarter Number → 20073
Year Month Numbers included → 200707 (Jul) + 200708 (Aug) + 200709 (Sep, if visible in context)
Only months in that same quarter and up to the current month are included.

Thank you :)
