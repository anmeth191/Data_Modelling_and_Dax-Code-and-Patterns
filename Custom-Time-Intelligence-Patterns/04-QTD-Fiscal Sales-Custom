This measure calculates Quarter-to-Date sales using fiscal keys, without TOTALQTD or other built-in Time Intelligence.
We rebuild the window explicitly with Year Month Number and Fiscal Year Quarter Number.

Prereqs

'Date'[Year Month Number] (e.g., 200705 for May 2007)
'Date'[Fiscal Year Quarter Number] (encoded however your model defines FY quarters)
Relationship between Sales and Date

Fiscal QTD Sales = 
// find the max Year Month Number in the current filter context (e.g., 200705 for May 2007)
VAR YearMonthNumber = MAX('Date'[Year Month Number])

// find the current Fiscal Year-Quarter key in the current filter context 
VAR currentFiscalQuarter = MAX('Date'[Fiscal Year Quarter Number])

VAR result =
    CALCULATE(
        Sales[Sales Amount],

        // remove any filters on the Date table so we can rebuild the window explicitly
        REMOVEFILTERS('Date'),

        // include all months up to the current month in context
        'Date'[Year Month Number] <= YearMonthNumber,

        // but only those months that belong to the same fiscal quarter in context
        'Date'[Fiscal Year Quarter Number] = currentFiscalQuarter
    )

RETURN
    result

How it behaves:

If fiscal year starts in March and the current row is May 2007:
YearMonthNumber → 200705

currentFiscalQuarter → (your FY Q1 key  which includes months Mar–May 2007)
Included months → 200703, 200704, 200705
Result → sum of [Sales Amount] for those months only.

If the row is August 2007 (FY Q2 = Jun–Aug):
Included months → 200706, 200707, 200708

Notes
ALL('Date') Produces the same effect
REMOVEFILTERS('Date') gives full control. We then reapply only the filters we need (quarter + up-to-current month).

Works with any fiscal start month as long as your date table’s FY columns are correct.
Keep this with your “using-no-time-intelligence” patterns. It pairs with your custom YTD Fiscal and QTD (Gregorian) measures.

Thank you :)
