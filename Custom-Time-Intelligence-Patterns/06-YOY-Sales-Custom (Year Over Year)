This measure calculates the Year-Over-Year (YOY) change in Sales by comparing the current year's value against the previous year's value.
Instead of relying on DAX built-in functions like PARALLELPERIOD, this pattern uses a custom Previous Year measure (PY Sales) as its foundation.

Dependency:
This measure will only work if the PY Sales measure is already implemented in your model.
The PY Sales measure handles the custom logic of retrieving sales for the same months of the previous year, bypassing the built-in SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR limitations for custom date tables.

YOY Sales

YOY Sales = 
//capture the current year sales
var ValueCurrentPeriod = Sales[Sales Amount]

//capture the previous year sales custom calculation
var ValuePreviousPeriod = [PY Sales] 

var result =
 //initialize validation
 IF( 
    //if the current value period is not blank and the previous then substract them only the true is evaluated
    NOT ISBLANK( ValueCurrentPeriod ) && NOT ISBLANK(ValuePreviousPeriod ) , 
    ValueCurrentPeriod - ValuePreviousPeriod 
)
return 
//return the result
result


Dependency – PY Sales
PY Sales =
var current_Year = SELECTEDVALUE('Date'[Year])
var PY_value = current_Year - 1 
var result =
     CALCULATE(
        [Sales Amount],  
        REMOVEFILTERS('Date'), 
        'Date'[Year] = PY_value, 
        VALUES('Date'[Month Number])
    )
return
result

How it Works
ValueCurrentPeriod gets the sales amount in the current filter context.
ValuePreviousPeriod retrieves the equivalent sales from the same months in the prior year via the PY Sales measure.
An IF statement ensures both values are not blank before subtracting, avoiding unwanted blank or incorrect results.

The calculation returns the difference:

YOY Sales = Current Year Sales − Previous Year Sales

Example:
If the current period is March 2008:
PY Sales will return sales for March 2007 (same month, previous year).
YOY Sales will subtract 2007’s value from 2008’s value.
