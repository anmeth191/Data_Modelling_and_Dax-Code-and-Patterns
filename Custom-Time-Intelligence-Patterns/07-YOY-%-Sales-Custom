This measure calculates the Year-Over-Year percentage change in sales.
It uses the YOY Sales measure as the numerator and the PY Sales measure as the denominator, both of which must already exist in your model.

Dependencies:

[YOY Sales] – Custom Year-over-Year difference measure.

[PY Sales] – Custom Previous Year Sales measure.


YOY % Sales = 
DIVIDE( [YOY Sales], [PY Sales] )

How it Works
[YOY Sales] returns the absolute difference between current and previous year sales.
[PY Sales] returns the previous year's sales for the same period.
DIVIDE is used instead of / to safely handle division by zero, returning BLANK when [PY Sales] is zero or blank.

The formula produces the percentage growth or decline compared to the previous year.

Example:
If:
YOY Sales = 20,000
PY Sales = 100,000

Then:
YOY % Sales= 
100,000
20,000
​= 0.20 (or 20%)

Thank you :)
