This measure calculates the Previous Fiscal Year Sales manually using fiscal year numbers, instead of relying on built-in time intelligence functions.

This approach is useful when:
You have a custom Date table with fiscal periods.
You want better performance and control over the filters applied.
You need to ensure the calculation works with non-standard fiscal calendars.

Dependencies
'Date'[Fiscal Year Number] – Numeric representation of the fiscal year (e.g., 2022).
'Date'[Month Number] – Month number for filtering within the fiscal year.
[Sales Amount] – Base measure for total sales.

Code:
PY Fiscal Sales = 

//Selected value captures the value of the current Fiscal Year in the filter context
var current_fiscal_year = SELECTEDVALUE( 'Date'[Fiscal Year Number] )
//Susbtract one year to the current fiscal year
var previous_fiscal_year = current_fiscal_year - 1
//Final Value
var result = CALCULATE( 
                        //Evaluate the Sales amount Measure
                       [Sales Amount] ,  
                       //Remove the Filter in the Date Table exposing all the years and Months
                        REMOVEFILTERS('Date'),
                        //Introduce filter for the Fiscal year Number column when  is equal to the value of previous year
                           'Date'[Fiscal Year Number] = previous_fiscal_year,
                           //Reintroduce the filter for the Month Number so it calculates the sales amount at the previous fiscal year Month level too
                              VALUES( 'Date'[Month Number] ))
                              return 
                              //return result
                              result
How It Works
Capture Current Fiscal Year
SELECTEDVALUE('Date'[Fiscal Year Number]) gets the fiscal year in the current filter context (e.g., 2023).
Find Previous Fiscal Year
Subtract 1 from the current fiscal year to get the previous fiscal year (e.g., 2022).
Clear Existing Filters
REMOVEFILTERS('Date') ensures the calculation is not restricted to the current filter context — all dates are made visible.
Reapply Custom Filters
Limit results to rows where the Fiscal Year Number equals the previous fiscal year.
Reintroduce the Month Number filter so results align month-by-month for the previous year.

Example
If today’s context is Fiscal Year 2024, Month 5:
current_fiscal_year → 2024
previous_fiscal_year → 2023
The measure returns sales from Fiscal Year 2023, Month 5 (and earlier months if in a cumulative calculation).
