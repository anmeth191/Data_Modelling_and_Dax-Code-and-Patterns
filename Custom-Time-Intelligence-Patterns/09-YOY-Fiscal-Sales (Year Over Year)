This measure return the difference between current fiscal period sales and the previous fiscal year’s corresponding period, using your custom [PY Fiscal Sales] pattern.

Dependencies:

[Sales Amount]
[PY Fiscal Sales] (must shift to prior fiscal year and reapply the same month set)

Code

YOY Sales Fiscal = 
//Get the current fiscal year sales
 var current_fiscal_sales = Sales[Sales Amount]
//this measure needs to be in your model , this variable captures the previous year fiscal sales 
 var previous_fiscal_sales = [PY Fiscal Sales] 
 var results = 
              //If starts to evaluate
               IF( 
                //if current_fiscak_sales and previous_fiscal_sales are not blank then substract them , only the true parts is evaluated
                 NOT ISBLANK(current_fiscal_sales) && NOT ISBLANK(previous_fiscal_sales) , current_fiscal_sales - previous_fiscal_sales )
                 return 
                 //return results
                  results

How it works
current_fiscal_sales → sales in the current fiscal filter context.
previous_fiscal_sales → pulls the same fiscal months from the prior fiscal year.
IF(...) guards against blanks so you don’t show misleading diffs when one side is empty.

Pair it with (optional)
YOY % Fiscal:
YOY % Fiscal = DIVIDE( [YOY Sales Fiscal], [PY Fiscal Sales] )
Uses DIVIDE to avoid divide-by-zero issues.

Thank you :)
