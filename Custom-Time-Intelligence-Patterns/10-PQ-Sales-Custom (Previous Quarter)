This measure calculates sales for the prior quarter without using built-in time intelligence functions like PARALLELPERIOD.
It works on a custom Date table by leveraging Year Quarter Number and Month In Quarter Number columns.

Important behavior:

At quarter level (no months in rows), returns the full prior quarter sales.
At month level (inside a quarter), returns only the same month position in the prior quarter (e.g., Month-in-Quarter 2 returns Month 2 of the prior quarter).

Code:
PQ Sales = 
//get the value of the quarter number numeric value  
VAR currentYearQuarterNumber = MAX('Date'[Year Quarter Number])

//get the previous quarter Number numeric value
VAR previousQuarterNumber = currentYearQuarterNumber - 1

VAR results =
    CALCULATE(
        //calculate the sales amount 
        Sales[Sales Amount],

        //remove any filters affecting the date table , ALL can achieve the same goal 
        REMOVEFILTERS('Date'),

        //Introduce new filter when the quarter number is equal to the previous quarter
        'Date'[Year Quarter Number] = previousQuarterNumber,

        //introduce new filter for the month in quarter affecting previous quarter months 
        VALUES('Date'[Month In Quarter Number])
    )
RETURN
    //return the result
    results

How it Works
Identify current quarter number
We get the Year Quarter Number from the current filter context. This column must be numeric, e.g., Year * 4 + Quarter - 1, so it increases sequentially across years.

Find prior quarter number
Subtract 1 from the current quarter number to get the prior quarter’s numeric key.

Clear all existing Date filters
REMOVEFILTERS('Date') ensures we start fresh with all dates visible, avoiding interference from the current filter context.

Apply prior quarter filter
We filter 'Date'[Year Quarter Number] to equal the prior quarter number.

Reintroduce month-in-quarter filter
VALUES('Date'[Month In Quarter Number]) ensures that if we’re at month level, we only get the matching month position from the prior quarter (e.g., month 2 in current quarter → month 2 in prior quarter).

Example Behavior
Scenario: Current context = Q2 2025
Quarter-level visual: Returns sales for Q1 2025.

Month-level visual:
April (Month-in-Quarter = 1) → January sales (Month-in-Quarter = 1 of Q1 2025)
May (Month-in-Quarter = 2) → February sales (Month-in-Quarter = 2 of Q1 2025)

Dependencies
'Date'[Year Quarter Number] – Numeric sequence of quarters across years
'Date'[Month In Quarter Number] – Numeric 1..3 (or 1..4 for 4-month quarters) representing position within quarter
[Sales Amount] – Base measure for sales
