This measure calculates the difference in sales between the current quarter and the prior quarter, without relying on built-in DAX time intelligence functions.

It uses [PQ Sales] Custom calculation as a dependency to retrieve prior quarter sales.

Code

QOQ Sales = 
// Capture the current quarter's sales from the base Sales Amount measure
VAR value_current_quarter = Sales[Sales Amount] 

// Retrieve the prior quarter's sales using the custom PQ Sales pattern
VAR value_previous_quarter = [PQ Sales] 

// Only perform the subtraction if both values are not blank
VAR result =
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(value_current_quarter) &&
        NOT ISBLANK(value_previous_quarter),
        value_current_quarter - value_previous_quarter
    )

RETURN
    result

How it Works
Current Quarter Sales
Directly reads from [Sales Amount], which respects the current filter context.

Previous Quarter Sales
Pulls in [PQ Sales] — a custom measure that calculates sales for the prior quarter (month-position aware if used with month-level visuals).

Validation
IF checks that both current and previous quarter sales are not blank.
This avoids returning misleading results when data is missing.

Calculation
Subtracts the previous quarter sales from the current quarter sales.

Dependencies
[Sales Amount] – Base measure for sales.
[PQ Sales] – Prior quarter sales, either full quarter or month-position aware version.

Example Behavior
If [Sales Amount] = 200,000 for Q2 2025 and [PQ Sales] = 180,000 for Q1 2025:
QOQ Sales = 200,000 - 180,000 = 20,000
