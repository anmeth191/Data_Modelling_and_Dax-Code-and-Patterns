This measure calculates the percentage change in sales between the current quarter and the prior quarter.
It uses [QOQ Sales] for the change in value and [PQ Sales] for the prior quarter baseline.

Code
QOQ Sales % =
DIVIDE(
    [QOQ Sales],   // Difference between current and prior quarter sales
    [PQ Sales]     // Prior quarter sales (baseline for percentage)
)
How it Works
Numerator → [QOQ Sales]
Comes from the previous pattern, representing the absolute change in sales between the two quarters.

Denominator → [PQ Sales]
Represents the prior quarter’s sales, serving as the baseline for percentage change.

Division Handling
DIVIDE is used instead of the / operator to safely handle divide-by-zero cases — if [PQ Sales] is zero or blank, the result will return blank instead of an error.

Dependencies
[QOQ Sales] – Quarter-over-quarter absolute sales change.
[PQ Sales] – Prior quarter sales.

Example Behavior
If [QOQ Sales] = 20,000 and [PQ Sales] = 180,000:
QOQ Sales % = 20,000 / 180,000 = 0.1111 → 11.11%
