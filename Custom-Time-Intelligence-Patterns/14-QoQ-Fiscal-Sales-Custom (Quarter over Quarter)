This measure calculates the sales difference between the current fiscal quarter and the previous fiscal quarter.
It uses the [Fiscal Sales PQ] measure as a dependency to obtain the prior fiscal quarterâ€™s sales.

Code
QOQ Fiscal Sales =
//get the value of the current Fiscal Quarter
VAR current_fiscal_value = [Sales Amount]
//Get the value of the Previous fiscal Quarter , this measure should be already exisiting in the model
VAR previous_fiscal_value = [Fiscal Sales PQ]
VAR result =
    IF(
 //Validate with IF statement to ensure both values are non-blank before performing the subtraction.
        NOT ISBLANK(current_fiscal_value) &&
        NOT ISBLANK(previous_fiscal_value),
        current_fiscal_value - previous_fiscal_value
    )
RETURN
    result

How it Works
Current Fiscal Quarter Sales
current_fiscal_value captures the sales amount for the fiscal quarter in the current filter context.

Previous Fiscal Quarter Sales
previous_fiscal_value retrieves the result from your [Fiscal Sales PQ] measure.

Validation
The IF statement ensures both values are non-blank before performing the subtraction.
This prevents returning misleading numbers when data is missing for one of the quarters.

Calculation
If both values exist, it subtracts:
Current Fiscal Quarter Sales - Previous Fiscal Quarter Sales

Dependencies
[Sales Amount] measure
[Fiscal Sales PQ] measure (must be created first)
A properly configured Date table with fiscal columns.

Example
If:
FQ3-2024 sales = $120,000
FQ2-2024 sales = $100,000
Then:
QOQ Fiscal Sales = 120,000 - 100,000 = 20,000
