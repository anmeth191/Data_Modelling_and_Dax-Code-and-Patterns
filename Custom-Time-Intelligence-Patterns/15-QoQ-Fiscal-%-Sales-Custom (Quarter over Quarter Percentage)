This measure calculates the percentage change in sales between the current fiscal quarter and the previous fiscal quarter.
It uses [QOQ Fiscal Sales] for the numerator and [Fiscal Sales PQ] for the denominator.

Code
QOQ Fiscal % =
DIVIDE(
    [QOQ Fiscal Sales],
    [Fiscal Sales PQ]
)
How it Works
Numerator – QOQ Fiscal Sales
[QOQ Fiscal Sales] returns the absolute difference in sales between the current and previous fiscal quarter.

Denominator – Previous Fiscal Quarter Sales
[Fiscal Sales PQ] provides the sales amount for the previous fiscal quarter.

Division with Safety
DIVIDE is used instead of the / operator to avoid errors when the denominator is blank or zero.
If the denominator is zero or blank, the result will be BLANK().

Final Output
The formula computes:
(Current Fiscal Quarter Sales – Previous Fiscal Quarter Sales)
÷ Previous Fiscal Quarter Sales

Dependencies
[QOQ Fiscal Sales] measure
[Fiscal Sales PQ] measure
A properly configured Date table with fiscal columns.

Example
If:
FQ3-2024 sales = $120,000
FQ2-2024 sales = $100,000
Then:
QOQ Fiscal Sales = 20,000
QOQ Fiscal % = 20,000 / 100,000 = 0.20 → 20%
