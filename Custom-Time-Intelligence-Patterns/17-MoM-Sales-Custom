This measure calculates the change in sales between the current month and the previous month.
It is a custom time intelligence pattern that depends on the [PM Sales] measure (previous month sales).
The calculation checks for non-blank values in both the current and previous month to avoid returning misleading results when data is missing.

Dependencies:
[PM Sales] – A measure that calculates the sales amount for the month immediately prior to the current filter context.

Code:

MOM Sales = 
//get the current Month Sales
VAR current_Month_Sales = Sales[Sales Amount]
//Get previous Month Sales , this measure needs to be defined in your model
VAR previous_month_sales = [PM Sales]

VAR results = 
  IF ensures both values are not blank, preventing calculations from returning false deltas in months with no data.
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_Month_Sales) &&
        NOT ISBLANK(previous_month_sales),
        current_Month_Sales - previous_month_sales
    )
RETURN
    results

How it works:

Current Month Sales:
Captures the sales amount in the current filter context.

Previous Month Sales:
Pulls the result of the [PM Sales] measure, which uses the Year Month Number logic to fetch the previous month’s values.

Blank Check:
IF ensures both values are not blank, preventing calculations from returning false deltas in months with no data.

Difference Calculation:
Subtracts the previous month’s sales from the current month’s sales, returning the variation amount.
