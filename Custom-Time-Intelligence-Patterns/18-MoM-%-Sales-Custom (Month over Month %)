This measure calculates the percentage change in sales between the current month and the previous month.
It is built on top of the [MOM Sales] and [PM Sales] measures.
By dividing the sales variation by the previous month’s sales, it expresses growth or decline as a percentage.

Dependencies:

[MOM Sales] – The month-over-month variation in absolute terms.
[PM Sales] – The previous month’s sales amount.

Code:
MOM Sales % = 
DIVIDE(
    [MOM Sales], 
    [PM Sales]
)

How it works:
Numerator: [MOM Sales] returns the absolute change in sales between the current month and the previous month.
Denominator: [PM Sales] returns the sales from the previous month.
Division: DIVIDE handles the division and returns BLANK() automatically if the denominator is zero or blank, avoiding errors.

Interpretation:

Positive % → Growth from last month.
Negative % → Decline from last month.
0% → No change compared to last month.

Thank you :)
