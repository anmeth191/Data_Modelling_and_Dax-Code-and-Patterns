This measure dynamically calculates the change between the current period and the previous period, based on the granularity shown in the report visual.
It works at month, quarter, and year levels by leveraging ISINSCOPE() to detect the current context, then calls the appropriate measure:

Month level → MOM Sales (Month-over-Month change)
Quarter level → QOQ Sales (Quarter-over-Quarter change)
Year level → YOY Sales (Year-over-Year change)

This removes the need to create multiple visuals or manually switch measures.

Dependencies:
[MOM Sales] – Month-over-Month sales change.
[QOQ Sales] – Quarter-over-Quarter sales change.
[YOY Sales] – Year-over-Year sales change.

Code:
POP Sales =  
SWITCH( TRUE() , 
      ISINSCOPE( 'Date'[Year Month] ) , [MOM Sales],
      ISINSCOPE( 'Date'[Year Quarter] ) , [QOQ Sales], 
      ISINSCOPE( 'Date'[Year] ) , [YOY Sales] 
)

How it works:

SWITCH(TRUE()):
This pattern evaluates each logical test sequentially until one is TRUE.

ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year Month]):
Checks if the current visual granularity is Year-Month. If yes → returns [MOM Sales].

ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year Quarter]):
Checks if the granularity is Year-Quarter. If yes → returns [QOQ Sales].

ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year]):
Checks if the granularity is Year. If yes → returns [YOY Sales].

Dynamic Behavior:
The measure adapts automatically to the visual’s level, reducing maintenance and avoiding multiple “static” measures.
