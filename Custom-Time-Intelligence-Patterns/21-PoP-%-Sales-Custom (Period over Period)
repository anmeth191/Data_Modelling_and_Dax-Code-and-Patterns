This measure dynamically returns the correct period-over-period (PoP) percentage for Sales depending on the current level of the date hierarchy in the visual:

Code
POP % Sales =
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    ISINSCOPE( 'Date'[Year Month] ), Sales[Sales MOM %],
    ISINSCOPE( 'Date'[Year Quarter] ), Sales[Sales QOQ %],
    ISINSCOPE( 'Date'[Year] ), [Sales YOY %]
)

How It Works
ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year Month]) checks if the visual is showing data at the month level → returns Month-over-Month %.
If not, it checks for quarter level with ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year Quarter]) → returns Quarter-over-Quarter %.
If not, it checks for year level with ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year]) → returns Year-over-Year %.
No fallback is provided, so visuals without one of these levels in scope will return BLANK.
This avoids the need for multiple separate measures and ensures the measure adapts based on how the user drills or slices the date hierarchy.

Thank you :)
