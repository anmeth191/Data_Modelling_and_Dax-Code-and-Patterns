(Moving Annual Total — trailing 12 months of sales)

MAT Sales =
CALCULATE(
    [Sales Amount],
    DATESINPERIOD(
        'Date'[Date],
        MAX('Date'[Date]),
        -1,
        YEAR
    )
)

Explanation:
MAX('Date'[Date]) → Anchors the period ending at the last visible date in the current filter context.
DATESINPERIOD(..., -1, YEAR) → Returns a 12-month window ending at the current date, moving dynamically based on slicers or visuals.
CALCULATE(...) → Aggregates [Sales Amount] over that dynamic 12-month range.

This gives you a rolling 12-month total, updated automatically for the context.

Use Case:
Financial statements (income, revenue, expense tracking)
Smoothing seasonality — better than YTD in many business reviews
Comparing consistent trailing periods

Tip:
If you're using a DateWithSales or ShowValueForDates safeguard, you can enhance the measure like this:

MAT Sales :=
IF(
    [ShowValueForDates],
    CALCULATE(
        [Sales Amount],
        DATESINPERIOD('Date'[Date], MAX('Date'[Date]), -1, YEAR)
    )
)
This ensures you don’t show rolling totals beyond the last actual sale — which avoids bloated visuals and misleading data.

Summary:
DATESINPERIOD is one of the most flexible date functions — you can shift by day, month, quarter, year.
Unlike SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, this does not need aligned calendar years — it just counts backwards in time from a reference date.

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION: MAT ≠ YTD

YTD is anchored to the start of the calendar or fiscal year.
MAT is a rolling window of the last 12 months, regardless of year boundaries.

Behavior in Context:
At the start of the year, MAT and YTD might look very similar — both summing sales from January to the current month.
But once the year rolls over, the difference becomes clear:

Example: Current month is July 2025
YTD Sales will calculate from:
Jan 1, 2025 → July 31, 2025

MAT Sales will calculate from:
Aug 1, 2024 → July 31, 2025
(rolling 12-month window — not bound to the new year)

Under the Hood – What MAT does:
DATESINPERIOD creates a virtual table of dates going back 12 months from the current max visible date. So if you're in July 2025, MAT will internally evaluate:

July 2025  
June 2025  
May 2025  
April 2025  
March 2025  
February 2025  
January 2025  
December 2024  
November 2024  
October 2024  
September 2024  
August 2024 ← oldest month in the window

Whereas YTD will only look at:
January 2025 → July 2025
Final Take:
Use YTD for goal tracking within a fiscal/calendar year.
Use MAT when you need trend analysis, especially when seasonality matters.
They may align for a few months, but their behavior will diverge over time.

Thank you : )
