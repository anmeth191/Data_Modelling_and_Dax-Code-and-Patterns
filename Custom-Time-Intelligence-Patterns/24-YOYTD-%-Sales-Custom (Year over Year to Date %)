Calculates the percentage change in Year-To-Date Sales compared to the previous year — showing how much sales have grown or declined relative to last year’s performance for the same period.

Code
YOYTD Sales % = 
DIVIDE( [YOYTD Sales], [PYTD Sales] )

How it works
Uses your existing [YOYTD Sales] (current YTD – previous YTD) as the numerator.
Uses [PYTD Sales] as the denominator, representing last year’s baseline.
DIVIDE() handles division by zero safely — it will return BLANK() if [PYTD Sales] is zero or blank, avoiding errors or misleading output.

Examples
YTD Sales	PYTD Sales	YOYTD Sales	YOYTD Sales %
120,000   100,000	    20,000	          20%
80,000	  100,000	   -20,000	         -20%
105,000	  0	          105,000	          (blank)

Interpretation:

If current YTD is higher than PYTD → positive growth (e.g., 20%).
If lower → negative growth (decline).
If prior year had no sales (zero), the result is blank to avoid a divide-by-zero situation.

Thank you :)
