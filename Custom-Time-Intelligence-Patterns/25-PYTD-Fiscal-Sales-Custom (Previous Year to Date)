Calculates Previous Fiscal Year-To-Date Sales, based on the fiscal calendar structure (e.g., July–June). This is useful when comparing current fiscal performance to the same fiscal period last year.

Code
PYTD Fiscal Sales = 
// Get the highest visible fiscal month in the current filter context (e.g., Month 4 = October if fiscal starts in July)
VAR current_month_filter_context = MAX( 'Date'[Fiscal Month Number] )

// Get the selected fiscal year (e.g., 2025 if current context is FY25)
VAR current_year_filter_context = SELECTEDVALUE( 'Date'[Fiscal Year Number] )

// Subtract one to get the previous fiscal year
VAR previous_fiscal_year = current_year_filter_context - 1 

// Calculate the result
VAR result = 
    CALCULATE( 
        // Total sales amount
        Sales[Sales Amount],

        // Remove all filters from the Date table
        REMOVEFILTERS('Date'),

        // Apply filter for fiscal months up to and including the current month
        'Date'[Fiscal Month Number] <= current_month_filter_context,

        // Apply filter for only the previous fiscal year
        'Date'[Fiscal Year Number] = previous_fiscal_year
    )

// Return the final value
RETURN result

How it works

Detects the fiscal month and fiscal year currently visible in the filter context.
Calculates the previous fiscal year by subtracting 1.
Clears all filters on the 'Date' table to avoid conflicts.

Reapplies filters to:
Include all fiscal months up to the current one.
Include only rows from the previous fiscal year.
Returns the sales total from that matching period.

Examples
Assume Fiscal Year starts in July:
Fiscal Month	Fiscal Year	Filtered Context	PYTD Fiscal Sales
Oct (4)	FY25	Months 1–4	Sales from Months 1–4 of FY24
Mar (9)	FY25	Months 1–9	Sales from Months 1–9 of FY24

Interpretation:
If you're currently viewing YTD for FY25 up to month 4 (October), this measure will return sales for months 1–4 (July–October) of FY24.

Thank you :)
