Calculates the Year-Over-Year Fiscal Year-To-Date Sales Difference — comparing current fiscal YTD sales to the same fiscal period in the prior year. 
Useful for analyzing fiscal-year-based performance change over time.

Code
YOYTD Fiscal Sales = 
// Get current fiscal YTD sales
VAR current_ytd = [YTD Sales Fiscal] 

// Get previous fiscal YTD sales
VAR previous_ytd = [PYTD Fiscal Sales] 

// Return the difference if both values exist
VAR results = 
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_ytd) && NOT ISBLANK(previous_ytd),
        current_ytd - previous_ytd
    )

RETURN results

How it works

Pulls the current fiscal YTD sales using [YTD Sales Fiscal].
Retrieves the previous fiscal YTD sales from [PYTD Fiscal Sales].
Checks that both are not blank — protects against missing or incomplete data.
If valid, calculates the difference: current - previous.
Returns the result, or BLANK if one of the values is missing.

Examples
FY	  Fiscal Month	YTD Sales Fiscal	PYTD Fiscal Sales	YOYTD Fiscal Sales
FY25	Oct (4)	      180,000	          150,000	           30,000
FY24	Oct (4)	      150,000	          135,000	           15,000
FY23	Oct (4)	      135,000	          (blank)	           (blank)
Interpretation:

A value of 30,000 means you're up 30K compared to the same fiscal period last year.
If PYTD is missing (e.g., no data for FY23), result is blank.

Thank you :)
