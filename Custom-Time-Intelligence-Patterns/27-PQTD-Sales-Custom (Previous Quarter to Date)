Calculates Previous Quarter-To-Date Sales, comparing the same position within the quarter from the prior year. This is useful for quarter-over-quarter analysis aligned by position.

Code
PQTD Sales = 
// Get the last month number in the current quarter's filter context
VAR last_month_in_quarter_available = MAX( 'Date'[Month In Quarter Number] )

// Get the current quarter's Year-Quarter identifier 
VAR last_year_quarter_available = MAX( 'Date'[Year Quarter Number] )

// Get the previous year's equivalent quarter
VAR previous_year_quarter_available = last_year_quarter_available - 1 

// Calculate the sales amount for the previous QTD period
VAR result = 
    CALCULATE(
        // Evaluate sales amount
        [Sales Amount],

        // Remove all filters from the Date table so new filters can be applied
        REMOVEFILTERS( 'Date' ),

        // Filter to include all months up to and including the current position in the quarter
        'Date'[Month In Quarter Number] <= last_month_in_quarter_available,

        // Filter to include only the same quarter from the previous year
        'Date'[Year Quarter Number] = previous_year_quarter_available
    )

RETURN result

How it works

Finds the latest month number within the current quarter, based on 'Date'[Month In Quarter Number].
Retrieves the current Year-Quarter ID (e.g., 2025Q3).
Subtracts 1 to identify the previous yearâ€™s matching quarter (e.g., 2024Q3).
Removes all filters from 'Date' to reset the context.

Applies new filters to get:
All months up to the same relative point in the quarter.
Only rows from the previous year's matching quarter.
Returns the sales total from that prior QTD period.

Examples
Year	Quarter	Month In Quarter	Sales Amount	PQTD Sales
2025	Q3	    2 (Aug)	          65,000	      58,000
2024	Q3	    2 (Aug)	          58,000	      51,000
Interpretation:

If the visual is showing sales for the second month of Q3, PQTD Sales gives you the sales from second month of Q3 in the previous year.
Perfect for side-by-side visual comparisons of current QTD vs. last year's QTD at the same point.
