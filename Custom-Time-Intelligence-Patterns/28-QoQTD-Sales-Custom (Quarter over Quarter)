Calculates the Quarter-over-Quarter To-Date Sales Difference, comparing current Quarter-To-Date sales against the same relative period in the previous year's matching quarter.
This reveals how quarter-to-date performance is trending compared to last year at the same point in time.

Code
QOQTD Sales = 
// Get current quarter-to-date sales
VAR current_qtd_sales = [QTD Sales]

// Get previous year's same-quarter-to-date sales
VAR previous_year_qtd_sales = [PQTD Sales]

// Return the difference if both values exist
VAR results = 
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_qtd_sales) && NOT ISBLANK(previous_year_qtd_sales),
        current_qtd_sales - previous_year_qtd_sales
    )

RETURN results

How it works
Pulls the current QTD sales using [QTD Sales].
Retrieves the previous year’s QTD equivalent from [PQTD Sales].
Checks for non-blank values on both sides.
If both are available, calculates the delta: current – previous.
Returns the result, or BLANK() if either input is missing.

Examples
Year	Quarter	QTD Sales	PQTD Sales	QOQTD Sales
2025	Q3	    90,000	  82,000	    8,000
2024	Q3	    82,000	  76,000	    6,000
2023	Q3	    76,000	  (blank)	    (blank)

Interpretation:
A positive result means you're outperforming the same quarter’s position from the prior year.
A blank result indicates insufficient data (e.g., no PQTD match for that context).

Thank you :)
