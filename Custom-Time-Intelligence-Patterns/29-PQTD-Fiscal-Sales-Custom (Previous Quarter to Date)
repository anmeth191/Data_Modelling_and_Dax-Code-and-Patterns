Calculates Previous Fiscal Quarter-To-Date Sales, aligned to the same position within the quarter from the prior fiscal year.
This pattern is used when you're tracking progress in fiscal quarters and want to compare it against the equivalent point from last year's same fiscal quarter.

Code
PQTD Sales Fiscal = 
// Get the current fiscal month number within the quarter
VAR current_month_quarter_available = MAX( 'Date'[Fiscal Month In Quarter Number] )

// Get the current fiscal year + quarter key 
VAR current_year_quarter_available = MAX( 'Date'[Fiscal Year Quarter Number] )

// Subtract one to get the same fiscal quarter from the previous year
VAR previous_year_quarter = current_year_quarter_available - 1 

// Calculate the sales amount from that period
VAR results = 
    CALCULATE( 
        Sales[Sales Amount], 

        // Remove filters from the Date table to ensure full table visibility
        REMOVEFILTERS('Date'),

        // Include all fiscal months up to and including the current one in the quarter
        'Date'[Fiscal Month In Quarter Number] <= current_month_quarter_available,

        // Include only the same fiscal quarter from the previous year
        'Date'[Fiscal Year Quarter Number] = previous_year_quarter
    )

RETURN results

How it works

Identifies the current position within the fiscal quarter (e.g., Month 2 of Q3).
Finds the current fiscal year-quarter key and subtracts 1 to move to the prior yearâ€™s same quarter.
Clears all filters on 'Date' so it can apply custom logic cleanly.

Filters the data to include:
All fiscal months up to the current one in the quarter.
Only rows from the previous fiscal quarter (same position).

Returns total sales for that matched slice.

Examples
Fiscal Year	Quarter	Fiscal Month In Quarter    Sales Amount	  PQTD Sales Fiscal
FY25	      Q3	    2(Oct)	                   92,000	        83,000
FY24	      Q3	    2(Oct)	                   83,000	        77,500
Interpretation:

If you're in the second month of Q3 FY25, this measure pulls the first two months of Q3 FY24.
Lets you compare QTD progress at the same stage across fiscal years.

Thank you :)
