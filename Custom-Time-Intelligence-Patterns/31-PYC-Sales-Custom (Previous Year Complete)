Returns the total sales for the previous calendar year, matching the current filter context by year. Useful for comparing this year’s performance against the full results from last year.

Code
PYC Sales = 
// Get the currently selected year in the filter context
VAR current_year_number = SELECTEDVALUE( 'Date'[Year] )

// Subtract one to get the previous calendar year
VAR previous_year_number = current_year_number - 1

// Calculate sales for the previous year
VAR result = 
    CALCULATE( 
        Sales[Sales Amount], 

        // Remove all filters from the Date table
        REMOVEFILTERS( 'Date' ), 

        // Apply filter for the previous year
        'Date'[Year] = previous_year_number
    )

RETURN result

How it works
Detects the current year in the filter context.
Calculates the previous year by subtracting 1.
Clears all filters on 'Date' to ensure accurate application.
Reapplies a filter for the full previous year.
Returns total sales for that year.

Examples
Year (in context)	 Sales Amount	PYC Sales
2025	             135,000	    128,000
2024	             128,000	    117,500

Interpretation:
If the visual shows 2025, this measure returns sales from 2024.
Use this to compare current year totals side-by-side with last year’s full-year result.

Thank you :)
