Calculates the difference between current Year-To-Date Sales and the full sales of the previous calendar year. 
This is helpful when comparing current partial-year performance against last year’s total — a common metric in fast-growth or budget-sensitive environments.

Code
YTDOPY Sales =
 // Get current year-to-date sales
VAR current_sales_ytd = [YTD Sales]

// Get total sales for the full previous year
VAR previous_year_full_sales = [PYC Sales]

// Return the difference if both values exist
VAR results = 
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_sales_ytd) && NOT ISBLANK(previous_year_full_sales),
        current_sales_ytd - previous_year_full_sales
    )

RETURN results

How it works
Pulls current YTD sales from [YTD Sales].
Pulls full-year sales from the previous calendar year using [PYC Sales].
Checks that both values are present (non-blank).
Calculates the difference: YTD – Previous Full Year.
 Returns that result — or blank if either side is missing.

Examples
Year	YTD Sales	 PYC Sales	YTDOPY Sales
2025	90,000	    110,000	  -20,000
2024	110,000    140,000	  -30,000
2023	140,000	   117,500	  +22,500

Interpretation:
A negative result means you haven't yet matched last year's total.
A positive result means you've already exceeded the prior year — before the current year even ended.
Useful for real-time performance dashboards that highlight "Are we beating last year yet?"

Thank you :)
