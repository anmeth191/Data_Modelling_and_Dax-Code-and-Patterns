This measure returns total sales for the previous fiscal year, regardless of current filters. It’s used to compare full-year fiscal performance against the previous fiscal period
— especially important for businesses that operate on non-calendar fiscal calendars.

Code
PYC Fiscal Sales = 
// Get the current fiscal year from the filter context
VAR current_fiscal_year = SELECTEDVALUE( 'Date'[Fiscal Year Number] )

// Subtract one to get the previous fiscal year
VAR previous_fiscal_year = current_fiscal_year - 1 

// Calculate sales for the previous fiscal year
VAR results = 
    CALCULATE( 
        Sales[Sales Amount],

        // Remove all filters from the Date table to reset context , the calculat can see all the dates in the Date Tables
        REMOVEFILTERS('Date'),

        // Apply a filter to keep only the previous fiscal year
        'Date'[Fiscal Year Number] = previous_fiscal_year 
    )

RETURN
 results

How it works
Captures the current fiscal year from the filter context (e.g., FY25).
Subtracts one to get the prior fiscal year (e.g., FY24).
Clears any date filters to ensure a clean calculation base.
Reapplies a filter for the full previous fiscal year only.
Returns the total sales from that prior fiscal year.

Examples
Fiscal Year (in context)	Sales Amount	PYC Fiscal Sales
FY25	                    220,000	      205,000
FY24	                    205,000	      192,000

Interpretation:
If FY25 is selected in a slicer or visual, this measure returns FY24’s total sales.
This is your baseline when evaluating fiscal-year-over-fiscal-year trends.
