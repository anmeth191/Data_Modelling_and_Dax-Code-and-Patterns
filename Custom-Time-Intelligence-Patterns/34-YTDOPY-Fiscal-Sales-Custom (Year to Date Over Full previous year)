This measure calculates the Year-To-Date Over Previous Fiscal Year Sales Difference — comparing current fiscal YTD sales against the full sales from the previous fiscal year. 
Ideal for tracking whether the current year has already outpaced last year’s total performance.

Code
YTDOPY Fiscal Sales = 
// Get current fiscal year-to-date sales
VAR current_fiscal_ytd = [YTD Sales Fiscal]

// Get full previous fiscal year sales
VAR previous_full_sales = [PYC Fiscal Sales]

// Return the difference if both values exist
VAR results = 
//Validate if both numbers are not blank so the division would not be blank or error  
  IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_fiscal_ytd) && NOT ISBLANK(previous_full_sales),
        current_fiscal_ytd - previous_full_sales
    )

RETURN 
results

How it works

Grabs the current fiscal YTD value from [YTD Sales Fiscal].
Pulls the full prior fiscal year’s sales from [PYC Fiscal Sales].
Ensures both values are valid (not blank).
Subtracts previous year’s full total from current YTD.
Returns the result, or BLANK if either measure isn’t available.

Examples
Fiscal Year	YTD Sales Fiscal	PYC Fiscal Sales	YTDOPY Fiscal Sales
FY25	      260,000	          220,000	          +40,000
FY24	      198,000	          205,000	          -7,000
FY23	      210,000	          (blank)	          (blank)

Interpretation:
Positive result: current fiscal YTD has already passed last year’s total.
Negative result: still behind last year’s full total — good for early-in-year pacing.
Blank: likely due to missing data in either YTD or prior fiscal year.
