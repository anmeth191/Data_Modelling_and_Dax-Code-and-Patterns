Calculates the sales total for the previous calendar quarter, based on the current filter context. This is useful for quarter-over-quarter comparisons where the business uses standard (non-fiscal) quarters.

Code
PQC Sales = 
// Get the current Year-Quarter key 
VAR current_year_and_quarter = SELECTEDVALUE( 'Date'[Year Quarter Number] )

// Subtract 1 to get the previous quarter (e.g., 20242 - 1 = 20241)
VAR previous_quarter_number = current_year_and_quarter - 1 

// Calculate total sales for the previous quarter
VAR results = 
    CALCULATE( 
        [Sales Amount], 

        // Clear any filters on the Date table
        REMOVEFILTERS('Date'),

        // Reapply a filter for only the previous quarter
        'Date'[Year Quarter Number] = previous_quarter_number
    )

RETURN 
results

How it works
Pulls the current Year-Quarter key from the filter context (like 20242 for Q2 2024).
Subtracts 1 to calculate the previous quarterâ€™s key (20241 for Q1 2024).
Clears filters from 'Date' to ensure clean logic.
Applies a new filter for only the previous quarter using the Year Quarter Number.
Returns total sales from that quarter.

Examples
Year	Quarter	Year Quarter Number	Current Quarter Sales	PQC Sales (Previous Quarter)
2024	Q2	    20242	              102,000	              95,000
2024	Q1	    20241	              95,000	              110,000
2023	Q4	    20234	              110,000	              98,000

Interpretation:

For Q2 2024, the current sales are 102,000; the PQC Sales measure returns Q1 2024 = 95,000.
For Q1 2024, it pulls Q4 2023 = 110,000.
This enables quarter-over-quarter comparisons with accurate temporal alignment.

Thank you :)
