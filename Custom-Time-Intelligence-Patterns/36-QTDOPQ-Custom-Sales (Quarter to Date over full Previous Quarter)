Calculates the Quarter-To-Date Over Previous Full Quarter Sales Difference. It compares sales so far in the current quarter against the entire previous quarter. 
This is helpful for checking whether current performance is catching up to or surpassing the last quarter's total.

Code
QTDOPQ Sales = 
// Get current quarter-to-date sales
VAR current_qtd_values = [QTD Sales]

// Get full sales from the previous quarter
VAR previous_full_quarter_values = [PQC Sales]

// Return the difference if both values exist
VAR results = 
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_qtd_values) && NOT ISBLANK(previous_full_quarter_values),
        current_qtd_values - previous_full_quarter_values
    )

RETURN 
results

How it works
Pulls current QTD sales using [QTD Sales].
Retrieves the full previous quarter’s sales using [PQC Sales].
If both values are non-blank, subtracts previous from current.
Returns the result — or blank if either measure is unavailable.

Examples
| Quarter | Current QTD Sales | PQC Sales (Previous Quarter) | QTDOPQ Sales |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| Q2 2024 | 72,000            | 95,000                       | -23,000      |
| Q1 2024 | 95,000            | 112,000                      | -17,000      |
| Q4 2023 | 112,000           | 98,000                       | +14,000      |

Interpretation:
A negative result shows that current QTD performance is still trailing the last full quarter.
A positive result means you've already surpassed last quarter’s total — before this one is even over.
Useful for growth pacing and executive dashboards where the question is: “Are we beating last quarter yet?”

Thank you :)
