This measure returns sales from the previous fiscal quarter, based on the current fiscal quarter in context.
This is the fiscal version of a Quarter-over-Quarter base measure, useful in organizations with non-calendar fiscal calendars (e.g., Julyâ€“June).

Code
PQC Fiscal Sales = 
// Get the current fiscal Year-Quarter key 
VAR current_fiscal_year_quarter_number = SELECTEDVALUE( 'Date'[Fiscal Year Quarter Number] )

// Subtract 1 to get the previous fiscal quarter (e.g., 20253 - 1 = 20252)
VAR previous_fiscal_year_quarter_number = current_fiscal_year_quarter_number - 1 

// Calculate total sales for the previous fiscal quarter
VAR results = 
    CALCULATE( 
        [Sales Amount], 

        // Remove all filters on the Date table
        REMOVEFILTERS('Date'),

        // Apply filter for only the previous fiscal quarter
        'Date'[Fiscal Year Quarter Number] = previous_fiscal_year_quarter_number
    )

RETURN 
results

How it works
Grabs the current fiscal quarter key (e.g., 20253 for Q3 of FY2025).
Subtracts 1 to get the prior fiscal quarter key.
Removes existing filters on the Date table to allow full access to past data.
Applies a new filter to target only the previous fiscal quarter.
Returns the total sales for that quarter.

Examples
Fiscal Year	 Fiscal Quarter	 Current Quarter Sales	PQC Fiscal Sales (Previous Quarter)
FY25	       Q3	             88,000	                95,000
FY25	       Q2	             95,000	                101,000
FY25	       Q1	             101,000	              92,000

Interpretation:
When the current context is Q3 FY25, this measure returns sales from Q2 FY25.
For Q1 FY25, it returns Q4 FY24 (assuming Fiscal Year Quarter Number rolls over cleanly).
Ideal for building fiscal quarter-over-quarter growth metrics.
