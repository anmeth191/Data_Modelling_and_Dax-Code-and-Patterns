Calculates the Fiscal Quarter-To-Date Over Previous Full Fiscal Quarter Sales Difference.
It compares current QTD sales to the full sales of the previous fiscal quarter, which helps track whether the current quarter is on pace to outperform the last one.

Code
QTDOPQ Fiscal Sales = 
// Get current fiscal quarter-to-date sales
VAR current_fiscal_sales_qtd = [Fiscal QTD Sales]

// Get full sales from the previous fiscal quarter
VAR previous_full_fiscal_quarter = [PQC Fiscal Sales]

// Return the difference if both values exist
VAR results = 
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_fiscal_sales_qtd) && NOT ISBLANK(previous_full_fiscal_quarter),
        current_fiscal_sales_qtd - previous_full_fiscal_quarter
    )

RETURN results

How it works
Pulls current fiscal QTD sales from [Fiscal QTD Sales].
Retrieves full previous fiscal quarter sales from [PQC Fiscal Sales].
Ensures both values exist (non-blank).
Returns the difference between current QTD and the full previous quarter.
If either is blank, returns BLANK to avoid misleading output.

Examples
Fiscal Year	Fiscal Quarter	Fiscal QTD Sales	PQC Fiscal Sales	QTDOPQ Fiscal Sales
FY25	      Q3	            88,000	          95,000	          -7,000
FY25	      Q2	            95,000	          101,000	          -6,000
FY25	      Q1	            101,000	          92,000	          +9,000

Interpretation:

A negative value means current QTD is still trailing last quarterâ€™s full sales.
A positive value means current QTD has already outperformed the full previous fiscal quarter.
Useful for tracking quarter pacing and triggering performance alerts in dashboards.
