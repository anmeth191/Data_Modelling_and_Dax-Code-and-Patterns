This measure calculates the Moving Annual Total (MAT) — the total sales over the most recent 12-month rolling window, ending in the current month.
It’s a useful way to smooth seasonality and spot long-term trends by always including the latest 12 months of data.

Code 
MAT Sales = 
// In this case, since it's an Annual Total, we use 12 months
var months_in_range = 12

// Capture the current month in the filter context as a numeric YYYYMM value
var current_filter_context_month = MAX('Date'[Year Month Number])

/*
  Find the first month in the rolling 12-month window.
  Example:
    If the current month is 2025-08 (202508),
    then 202508 - 12 = 202408,
    and we add 1 → 202409 to begin the rolling period.
    This ensures we count exactly 12 months, including the current.
*/
var first_month_of_the_window = current_filter_context_month - months_in_range + 1

// Calculate the total sales from the first month in range to the current
var result = CALCULATE( 
    [Sales Amount],
  //remove filters in the Date table so calculate can see all the dates 
    REMOVEFILTERS('Date'), 
//reintroduce filters where the dates are between the first month and the last month which is the current filter context
    'Date'[Year Month Number] >= first_month_of_the_window 
        && 'Date'[Year Month Number] <= current_filter_context_month
)

return 
    result

How it works

The variable months_in_range defines the size of the window (12 months).
Year Month Number is expected to be a continuous numeric field like 202508 (for August 2025).
The range starts 11 months before the current one, to ensure exactly 12 months are summed (inclusive).
REMOVEFILTERS('Date') allows the CALCULATE function to apply a fresh date range filter across the entire table.
Sales are aggregated across this calculated 12-month window.

Example

Assume the current filter context is August 2025 (202508):

Month	Year Month Number	Sales Amount
Sep 2024	 202409	      9,000
Oct 2024	 202410	      8,500
...	       ...	        ...
Jul 2025	 202507	      10,200
Aug 2025	 202508	      9,800

The total MAT Sales for Aug 2025 would be the sum of these 12 months (from Sep 2024 to Aug 2025).
If any month is missing, the result will underrepresent the full MAT unless handled with completeness rules in the data model.

Thank you :)
