This measure calculates the Previous Year’s Moving Annual Total (PYMAT).
It looks at the same 12-month rolling window from one year ago, which is critical when doing year-over-year comparisons for moving totals — like MAT vs PYMAT, or MAT % Growth.

Code 
PYMAT Sales = 
// Get the months to include in the rolling period (12 months for annual total)
var months_in_range = 12

// Get the month that is 12 months before the current one
// Example: If current = 2025-08 (202508), this becomes 202408
var current_filter_context_month = MAX('Date'[Year Month Number]) - months_in_range

// Calculate the start of the rolling window (12 months total)
// Example: 202408 - 12 + 1 = 202309 → starts in Sep 2023
var first_month_of_period = current_filter_context_month - months_in_range + 1

// Calculate sales over the previous 12-month window
var results = CALCULATE(
    [Sales Amount],
    REMOVEFILTERS('Date'),
    'Date'[Year Month Number] >= first_month_of_period 
        && 'Date'[Year Month Number] <= current_filter_context_month
)

return 
    result

How it works
The measure subtracts 12 months from the current Year Month Number to find the end of the previous rolling window.
It then subtracts another 11 months (plus 1) to get the start of that 12-month window.
REMOVEFILTERS('Date') ensures the new date range is applied cleanly.
Finally, it calculates total sales between first_month_of_period and current_filter_context_month, giving the rolling total for the same period one year ago.

Example

Assume current filter context is Aug 2025 (202508):

current_filter_context_month = 202508 - 12 = 202408

first_month_of_period = 202408 - 12 + 1 = 202309

So, the rolling window is Sep 2023 to Aug 2024, and PYMAT Sales returns the sales total for that period.

Month	Year  Month Number	Sales Amount
Sep 2023    202309	      8,400
Oct 2023	  202310       	9,100
...	        ...         	...
Aug 2024	  202408	      9,800

If this 12-month total is 112,000, and your current MAT Sales for 2024–2025 is 125,000 — that would signal growth.
Comparing MAT vs PYMAT gives you trailing-period trend insight with seasonal smoothing.

Thank you :)
