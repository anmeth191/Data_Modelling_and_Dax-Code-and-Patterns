This measure calculates the Moving Annual Total Growth (MATG) — the year-over-year growth of sales over a rolling 12-month period. 
It compares the current 12-month total (MAT Sales) with the equivalent 12-month period from the prior year (PYMAT Sales).

It’s useful for understanding long-term sales trends while smoothing out short-term volatility.

DAX Code
MATG Sales = 
//get the current Moving Annual Total
var current_MAT_Value = [MAT Sales]
//get the previous MAT value
var previous_MAT_Value = [PYMAT Sales]
//validate both numbers are not blank so the number is not blank or invalid
var result = IF(
                NOT ISBLANK( current_MAT_Value ) && NOT ISBLANK( previous_MAT_Value ), 
                current_MAT_Value - previous_MAT_Value 
              )
return 
 result

How it works

[MAT Sales] returns the total sales for the last 12 months, ending in the current month in filter context.
[PYMAT Sales] returns the total sales for the same 12-month span, but shifted back one full year.
The measure subtracts the prior year’s MAT from the current MAT, producing the change in total sales over one year.
IF ensures the calculation only happens if both values are available, avoiding incorrect or misleading blanks.

Example
Let’s assume the current filter context is August 2025.

[MAT Sales] (Sept 2024 to Aug 2025) = 1,080,000
[PYMAT Sales] (Sept 2023 to Aug 2024) = 996,000

Then:
MATG Sales = 1,080,000 - 996,000 = 84,000
This means the business grew by 84,000 in sales over the trailing 12-month period compared to the same period last year.
