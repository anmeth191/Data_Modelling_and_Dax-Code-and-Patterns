Purpose
This DAX measure calculates sales amounts only by continent, removing the impact of all other filters applied in the visual or report — even when those filters are not present in the visual context.

DAX Code EXAMPLE 

country_sales := 
CALCULATE(
    [Sales Amount],
    REMOVEFILTERS(_sales),
    VALUES(Dim_country[Continent])
)

Explanation
This measure is designed for scenarios where you want to:
Ignore all filters applied on the fact table _sales (e.g., by product, customer, or time).
Retain or restore filtering based specifically on the Dim_country[Continent] column.

What this does:
REMOVEFILTERS(_sales) removes all existing filters from the sales table — even those from visuals, slicers, or cross-filtering.
VALUES(Dim_country[Continent]) reintroduces the current filter context for Continent, ensuring that the measure respects this dimension alone.
This gives you full control to evaluate [Sales Amount] by continent only, regardless of what other dimensions exist in the current visual or filter context.

Comparison: ALLEXCEPT vs. This Pattern

CALCULATE([Sales Amount] , 
ALLEXCEPT(_sales, Dim_country[Continent])  //ALLEXCEPT here works as intended but the column [Continent] must be present in the visual
)

Comparison 2:
CALCULATE([Sales Amount], 
REMOVEFILTERS(_Sales), //remove filters kicks in removing any filter from any column in the visual 
SUMMARIZE(Dim_country , Dim_country[Continent] )// summarize re-enters a virtual table and this table reactivates the filter for the column in te expression
)
)

Keeps filters only if they are already applied.
If Continent is not in the visual or slicers, no filter is applied for it.

Why REMOVEFILTERS + VALUES is better here
Restores the filter for Continent even if it is not in the visual.
More predictable and robust in different report layouts.

When to Use
You want to show aggregated values grouped only by a specific column, e.g., continent.
Other dimensions should not influence the result.
You want reliable behavior even when the visual doesn’t explicitly filter on the retained column.
