This repo documents how DAX detects filters, how filter propagation works across a star schema, and when to use ISFILTERED vs ISCROSSFILTERED.
All examples assume a standard Customer → Sales ← Product model unless stated otherwise.

1. ISFILTERED(Column)
Meaning
Returns TRUE if the column is directly filtered in the current filter context.

What counts as “direct”
Slicer on that column
Filter pane on that column
Visual interaction targeting that column
CALCULATE( …, Table[Column] = value ) on that same column

What does NOT count
Filters on other columns in the same table
Filters coming from related tables
Relationship propagation

Best use cases
Detecting user intent
UX logic (warnings, messages, conditional formatting)
“Did the user explicitly filter this field?”

Example

ISFILTERED(Product[Brand])
If Product[Color] = "Red" is applied:
ISFILTERED(Product[Brand]) → FALSE
ISFILTERED(Product[Color]) → TRUE

2. ISCROSSFILTERED(Column)
Meaning
Returns TRUE if the column’s visible values are reduced, either:
directly, or indirectly (same table or via relationships)

Important rule
All filtered columns are cross-filtered, but not all cross-filtered columns are filtered.

Best use cases
Detecting data reduction
Validating whether results are partial
Understanding whether values are missing due to context

Example:
Same-table behavior (predictable) 
CALCULATE(
    ISCROSSFILTERED(Product[Brand]),
    Product[Color] = "Red"
)

ISFILTERED(Product[Brand]) → FALSE
ISCROSSFILTERED(Product[Brand]) → TRUE
Because the Product table is reduced.

IMPORTANT !!!!! USE THIS AS RECOMMENDED BY SQLBI EXPERTS !

3. ISCROSSFILTERED(Table)

Meaning
Returns TRUE if any column in the table is cross-filtered.
This is the most robust and recommended pattern in real models.

Why this is preferred
Filters converge on the fact table
You usually care whether the result set is constrained, not which column caused it
Column-level checks are brittle

Best use cases
Fact table completeness checks
Conditional totals logic
“Am I looking at a filtered subset of data?”

Example
ISCROSSFILTERED(Sales)

This returns TRUE when:
Customer is filtered
Product is filtered
Date is filtered
Any dimension reduces Sales rows
Relationship Direction Matters (Critical) In a standard star schema: Customer ─▶ Sales ◀─ Product

Customer filters Sales (YES) 
Product filters Sales  (YES)
Sales does NOT filter Product (NO)
Sales does NOT filter Customer (NO)

Therefore:
ISCROSSFILTERED(Product)
will return FALSE when only Customer is filtered — unless you explicitly enable bidirectional filtering.

Forced Bidirectional Example (Validation Tool)

ISCROSSFILTERED_Product_Bidirectional =
CALCULATE(
    ISCROSSFILTERED(Product),
    CROSSFILTER(Product[ProductKey], Sales[ProductKey], BOTH)
)
Use this only when you intentionally want fact → dimension propagation inside a measure.

Total Row Behavior (Sanity Check)

At the Total level:
No dimension is in scope
No filters are applied
No rows are reduced

Therefore:
ISFILTERED(*) → FALSE
ISCROSSFILTERED(*) → FALSE
If this is not true, your model or visual context is leaking filters.

Visual Validation (From the Book)

The recreated matrix demonstrates all rules simultaneously:

Context	  ISFILTERED	ISCROSSFILTERED(Customer)	ISCROSSFILTERED(Sales)	ISCROSSFILTERED(Product)	Product (Bidirectional)
Continent	FALSE	      TRUE	                    TRUE	                  FALSE	                    TRUE
Gender	    TRUE	      TRUE	                    TRUE	                  FALSE	                    TRUE
Total	    FALSE	      FALSE	                    FALSE	                  FALSE                    	FALSE

Why this matters

Confirms fact-table convergence

Proves relationship direction controls cross-filtering
Shows why table-level checks are safer than column-level ones

Final Rules of Thumb (Pin These)
Detect user intent → ISFILTERED(Dimension[Column])
Detect data reduction → ISCROSSFILTERED(FactTable)
Same-table indirect effects → ISCROSSFILTERED(Column)
Cross-table effects → depend on relationship direction
Totals should be FALSE → always verify

Thank you :) !
