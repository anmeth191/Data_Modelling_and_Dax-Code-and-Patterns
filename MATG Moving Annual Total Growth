Calculates the absolute difference between the current Moving Annual Total and the prior year's MAT, enabling clear YoY trailing performance analysis.

This is the delta, not the % — useful for execs who want to know how much more or less was sold in the last 12 months compared to the prior year.

MATG Sales :=
VAR current_mat = [Sales MAT]
VAR previous_mat = [PYMAT Sales]
VAR result =
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_mat) && NOT ISBLANK(previous_mat),
        current_mat - previous_mat
    )
RETURN
    result



Dependencies

You need:
[Sales MAT] → Current rolling 12-month sales
CALCULATE([Sales Amount]  , DATESINPERIOD(Date[Date] , MAX(Date[Date]) , -12 , MONTH))

[PYMAT Sales] → Prior year rolling 12-month sales
CALCULATE( [Sales MAT] ,  DATEADD(Date[Date]  , -12, MONTH ))

[ShowValueForDates] → Boolean control for visual cleanliness
var max_date = CALCULATE(MAX(Sales[Order Date]) , REMOVEFILTERS())
var current_date = MIN(Date[Date])
return
current_date <= max_date

Business Value
Tracks performance trends beyond static fiscal/calendar year boundaries.
Highlights whether trailing 12-month sales are growing or shrinking.
Avoids misleading snapshots by considering rolling behavior.

MATG% Sales → % growth based on this delta (can be added as next pattern)
