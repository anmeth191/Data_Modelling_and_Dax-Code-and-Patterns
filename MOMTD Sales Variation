Month-over-Month-To-Date (MoMTD) Sales Delta
This DAX measure calculates the difference between current MTD and prior MTD sales, allowing you to track monthly performance progression up to the current day of the month.

DAX Measure

MoMTD Sales :=
VAR current_mtd_sales = [MTD Sales]
VAR previous_mtd_sales = [PMTD Sales]
VAR results =
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_mtd_sales) &&
        NOT ISBLANK(previous_mtd_sales),
        current_mtd_sales - previous_mtd_sales
    )
RETURN
    results

What It Does
Compares this month’s sales (up to today’s date) against the same number of days in the previous month

Avoids misleading visuals by guarding with ISBLANK() checks
Provides a clean delta value — no percentage noise, just the real $ or volume change

Dependency Measures
[MTD Sales] based on DATESMTD('Date'[Date])
[PMTD Sales] as shown earlier using DATEADD(..., -1, MONTH)
[ShowValueForDates] to ensure cutoffs work after last sale

Optional: MoMTD % Growth

MoMTD % Growth :=
VAR current = [MTD Sales]
VAR previous = [PMTD Sales]
RETURN
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current) && NOT ISBLANK(previous),
        DIVIDE(current - previous, previous)
    )

Use Cases
Daily-updated dashboards with real-time pacing
Executive reports showing if the month is trending better/worse than last
Visuals showing both deltas and % shifts for performance tracking
