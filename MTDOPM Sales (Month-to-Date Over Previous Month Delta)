This measure calculates the delta between the current MTD and the full previous month's sales, useful when analyzing partial vs. full periods.

MTDOPM Sales = 
VAR current_mtd = [Sales MTD]
VAR fullpreviousmonth = [PMC Sales]
VAR results = 
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_mtd) && NOT ISBLANK(fullpreviousmonth),
        current_mtd - fullpreviousmonth
    )
RETURN
    results


[Sales MTD] → Current month's accumulated sales up to the latest visible date
[PMC Sales] → Full previous month's total sales, using PARALLELPERIOD(..., -1, MONTH)

Dependencies:
Make sure [PMC Sales] is correctly defined like this:

PMC Sales = 
IF(
    [ShowValueForDates] && HASONEVALUE('Date'[Month]),
    CALCULATE([Sales Amount], PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date], -1, MONTH))
)

And your filter safeguard measure:

ShowValueForDates = 
VAR max_date_sales = CALCULATE(MAX('Sales'[Order Date]), REMOVEFILTERS())
VAR current_filter_context = MIN('Date'[Date])
RETURN
    current_filter_context <= max_date_sales

Use Case:
This pattern is especially helpful when:
You're mid-month and want to benchmark against last month's full performance
You need to detect trends or growth during the month as data accumulates

Thank you :)
