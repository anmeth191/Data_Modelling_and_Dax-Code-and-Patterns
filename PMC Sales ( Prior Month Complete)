 Prior Month Complete (PMC) Sales
This measure compares the current period’s performance against the full previous month, using PARALLELPERIOD to pull the entire month prior to the one currently in context.

DAX Measure

PMC Sales :=
IF(
    [ShowValueForDates] &&
    HASONEVALUE('Date'[Month]),
    CALCULATE(
        [Sales Amount],
        PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date], -1, MONTH)
    )
)

What It Does
PARALLELPERIOD(..., -1, MONTH) returns the entire month that came before the one currently in context.
HASONEVALUE('Date'[Month]) ensures the measure only evaluates when exactly one month is selected (avoids incorrect aggregation at higher levels).
[ShowValueForDates] acts as a safety switch to prevent evaluation past the latest available sales date.

Compare to Other MoM Patterns
Pattern	Behavior	Use Case
[PM Sales]	Shape-aware (matches current context range)	Apples-to-apples day-by-day comparison
[PMC Sales]	Full previous month total	Executive dashboards, pacingPREVIOUSMONTH	Also full prior month	Simpler syntax, but same behavior

Use Cases
MoM full-period benchmarking
KPI cards or scorecards where users expect fixed monthly totals
Comparing a partial current month vs a complete previous month

Considerations
Not apples-to-apples in early month stages → use only when full-month comparisons are acceptable
Use HASONEVALUE to prevent accidental over-aggregation (e.g., when multiple months are selected)

Dependencies: 

Make sure to have the Measure ShowValuesForDates :=
     var max_sales_date = calculate(max('Sales'[Order Sales]) , removefilters())
      var current_filter_context = min('Date'[Date])
        return 
          current_filter_context <= max_sales_date

This guard clause ensures that any time-based comparison measure (like PMC Sales) only evaluates up to the last known sales transaction date — preventing inflated
or misleading values after the data ends.
