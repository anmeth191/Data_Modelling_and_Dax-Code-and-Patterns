Prior Month-to-Date (PMTD) Sales
This DAX measure calculates sales for the same range of days in the previous month, matching the current month-to-date shape. It ensures comparisons are accurate by only including dates where sales were present.

DAX Measure

PMTD Sales :=
VAR date_table =
    CALCULATETABLE(
        DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, MONTH),
        'Date'[DateWithSales] = TRUE
    )
VAR results =
    IF(
        [ShowValueForDates],
        CALCULATE([MTD Sales], date_table)
    )
RETURN
    results

Key Concepts
DATEADD(..., -1, MONTH) shifts the current MTD range to the prior month
'Date'[DateWithSales] = TRUE ensures that only prior-month dates with actual sales are included
[ShowValueForDates] prevents this from returning false results after the last sales date

Dependencies
MTD Sales example:

MTD Sales :=
CALCULATE(
    [Sales Amount],
    DATESMTD('Date'[Date])
)

ShowValueForDates:

ShowValueForDates :=
VAR max_date = CALCULATE(MAX('Date'[Date]), REMOVEFILTERS())
VAR min_date = MIN('Date'[Date])
RETURN
    min_date <= max_date

This shows progress month-over-month, aligned to the same day of the month, not the full month.

Thank you :)
