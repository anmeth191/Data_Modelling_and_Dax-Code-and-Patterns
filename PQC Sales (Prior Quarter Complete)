This measure compares the current quarter against the entire previous quarter, regardless of the current date. It pulls total sales from the previous quarter as a fixed reference point.

DAX Measure

PQC Sales :=
IF(
    [ShowValueForDates] &&
    HASONEVALUE('Date'[Year Quarter]),
    CALCULATE(
        [Sales Amount],
        PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date], -1, QUARTER)
    )
)

What It Does
PARALLELPERIOD(..., -1, QUARTER) returns the entire prior quarter relative to the current filter context

HASONEVALUE('Date'[Year Quarter]) ensures this only triggers when exactly one quarter is selected (avoids ambiguity or overaggregation)

[ShowValueForDates] keeps the logic clean — avoids returning values past the last sales date

CALCULATE(...) wraps the logic to apply the filter and return the actual prior quarter's sales

Compare to Other Patterns

Pattern	Returns	Use When
PQ Sales	Prior quarter, filter-respecting	Shape-aware, partial comparisons
PQC Sales	Full previous quarter total	Executive KPI, full period compare
PREVIOUSQUARTER	Same as PARALLELPERIOD (simpler)	For full quarters only

Use Cases
Quarter-over-quarter trend visuals
Dashboards where the current quarter may be incomplete, but you still want to see how it stacks up
Benchmarking full-quarter totals in time series visuals

Best Practices
Always use HASONEVALUE('Date'[Year Quarter]) to avoid incorrect rollups (like Year totals showing quarter-level logic)
Make sure 'Date'[Year Quarter] exists as a clean, unique field (e.g., "2024 Q3")
Avoid this in day-level visuals — it won’t behave predictably unless scoped to one quarter

Depencies
[ShowValueForDates]
This helper measure ensures calculations stop at the last available sales date, avoiding inflated totals when the current period continues past the real data.

ShowValueForDates :=
VAR max_date_sales =
    CALCULATE(
        MAX('Sales_Order'[Order_Date]),
        REMOVEFILTERS()
    )
VAR current_filter_context =
    MIN('Date'[Date])
RETURN
    current_filter_context <= max_date_sales

Purpose
Returns TRUE if the current date being evaluated is on or before the latest sales transaction
Returns FALSE for dates after the last recorded sale
Can be used to short-circuit measures and prevent misleading values beyond the known dataset
