Previous Calendar Year (PYC) Sales
This measure compares current period sales against the entire previous calendar year, using PARALLELPERIOD to shift the context back one full year, regardless of shape or filter depth.

DAX Measure

PYC Sales :=
IF(
    [ShowValueForDates],
    CALCULATE(
        [Sales Amount],
        PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR)
    )
)

What It Does
PARALLELPERIOD(..., -1, YEAR) shifts the filter context back by exactly one year
It preserves the shape of the context (month, quarter, year total — whatever you're looking at)
Works well for full-year-over-year comparisons
[ShowValueForDates] ensures you're not evaluating past the last valid sales date

PARALLELPERIOD vs SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR

Function	Behavior
SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR	Keeps same shape across years (e.g., Jan 1–15 last year if Jan 1–15 is selected now)
PARALLELPERIOD	Shifts filter context back exactly one full period, regardless of visual context
DATEADD(..., -1, YEAR)	More flexible, can work with irregular periods or handle non-standard calendars

Use Case
Use this measure when:

You want calendar year over calendar year comparison
You don’t want to limit to YTD or partial months
You're showing totals in KPI cards, bar charts, or annual performance reports

Caution
PARALLELPERIOD ignores filter shape — it just shifts back one full year
So if you’re looking at YTD in the current year, it’ll pull full prior year, unless controlled
Use SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR or DATEADD if you want to keep the shape (e.g., up to today only)

Variation 2:

This version uses PREVIOUSYEAR instead of PARALLELPERIOD, but the goal is the same:
Return total sales for the entire prior calendar year, regardless of the current filter shape.

DAX Measure

PYC Sales V2 :=
IF(
    [ShowValueForDates],
    CALCULATE(
        [Sales Amount],
        PREVIOUSYEAR('Date'[Date])
    )
)
What PREVIOUSYEAR Does
PREVIOUSYEAR('Date'[Date]) returns all dates from the previous calendar year
It doesn’t care if your current visual is filtered to Q1, July, or YTD — it will grab the entire previous year
It’s functionally very similar to:

PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR)
…but easier to read and sometimes performs better in optimized models.

Comparison
Function	Behavior	Use When...
PREVIOUSYEAR	Returns full prior calendar year	You want full-year comparison
PARALLELPERIOD	Shifts current filter by full period (e.g. year)	You need exact period offset
SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR	Matches shape of filter context (e.g. Jan 1–15 last year)	You're doing partial-period YoY

Pitfall
If you’re comparing current YTD with PREVIOUSYEAR, be careful:

[Sales Amount] = YTD

PREVIOUSYEAR('Date'[Date]) = full previous year
This skews the comparison unless you constrain both to the same period shape.
Best to pair this with a Sales YTD measure for a true YoY apples-to-apples:

PYTD Sales :=
CALCULATE(
    [Sales YTD],
    PREVIOUSYEAR('Date'[Date])
)

Use Case
Full-year-over-full-year KPIs
Executive dashboards where annual totals are needed regardless of filters
Simple YoY variance logic when exact context shape doesn’t matter

Thank you :)
