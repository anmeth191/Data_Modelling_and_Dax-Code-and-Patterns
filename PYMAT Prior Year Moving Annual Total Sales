This measure calculates the Moving Annual Total (MAT) for the same rolling window one year prior.
It enables apples-to-apples comparisons of trailing performance between this year and the prior year.

PYMAT Sales :=
IF(
    [ShowValueForDates],
    CALCULATE(
        [Sales MAT],
        DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR)
    )
)

How it Works
DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR) shifts the current filter context exactly one year back.
[Sales MAT] is then calculated over that new time window â€” effectively returning the MAT from the prior year.
Wrapping the logic in IF([ShowValueForDates]) prevents inaccurate values after the last sales date.

Use Case
Ideal for:
-Executive dashboards
-Year-over-year rolling performance
-Sales trend analysis
-Revenue growth tracking

Prerequisites
You must already have:

A working [Sales MAT] measure = 
CALCULATE(
    [Sales Amount],
    DATESINPERIOD('Date'[Date], MAX('Date'[Date]), -12, MONTH)
)

A [ShowValueForDates] Boolean control measure (used to hide values after the last available sales date)

ShowValueForDates :=
VAR max_sales_date = CALCULATE(MAX('Sales'[Order Date]), REMOVEFILTERS())
VAR current_context = MIN('Date'[Date])
RETURN
current_context <= max_sales_date

Thank you :)
