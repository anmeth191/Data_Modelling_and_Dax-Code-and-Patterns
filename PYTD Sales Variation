Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD) Sales
This DAX measure calculates Year-to-Date (YTD) sales from the previous year, based on the current filter context.
It uses DATEADD to shift the YTD window back one year, enabling accurate Year-over-Year comparisons while respecting the shape and cutoff of the current period.

Goal
To return the YTD sales total for the same period last year, aligned to the current date range (including partial YTD).

Measure Definition

PYTD Sales :=
VAR table_date =
   CALCULATETABLE(
        DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR),
        'Date'[DateWithSales] = TRUE
    )
RETURN
    IF(
        [ShowValueForDates],
        CALCULATE(
            [Sales YTD (Simple) Angel],
            table_date
        )
    )

Prerequisites
Your model should include:

A marked Date table with a unique Date column and Calculated Column DateWithSales
Calculated_column:

DateWithSales =  'Date'Date <= MAX('Sales'[Order_Date])

[ShowValueForDates] measure to avoid projecting beyond available data
ShowValueForDates := 
  var max_date = calculate(max('Date'[Date]) , removefilters())
    var min_date =  min(Date['Date'])
      return 
         min_date <= max_date

An existing YTD measure such as:

Sales YTD (Simple) Angel :=

CALCULATE(
    [Sales Amount],
    DATESYTD('Date'[Date])
)

Ensures fair YTD comparisons even for partial periods

Why It Works
DATEADD(..., -1, YEAR) shifts the current YTD date range back one year

That shifted table is passed into CALCULATE, applying the same YTD logic from last year

[ShowValueForDates] ensures results only show up to the last current sales date

Use Case
This measure is essential for:
YTD vs PYTD variance dashboards
KPI cards comparing performance to the same point last year
Time-series visuals where consistent date alignment is critical
