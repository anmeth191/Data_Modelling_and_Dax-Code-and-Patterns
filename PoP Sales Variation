Smart Time-Aware Comparison.

This pattern creates a single dynamic measure that adjusts automatically based on the time grain visible in the report.
Instead of creating separate measures for each time level (month, quarter, year), this smart measure uses ISINSCOPE() to detect the current visual level and 
returns the correct prior-period measure.

Goal
Automatically return the correct prior-period sales value, whether you're analyzing:

Month-over-Month
Quarter-over-Quarter
Year-over-Year

Measure Definition

PP Sales :=
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year Month]), [PM Month Sales],
    ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year Quarter]), [PQ Sales],
    ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year]), [PY Sales]
)

Prerequisites
Your model should include:
A well-structured Date table with:
'Date'[Year Month] – e.g., "2023-08"
'Date'[Year Quarter] – e.g., "2023 Q3"
'Date'[Year] – e.g., 2023

These measures:

[PM Month Sales] – Previous month sales with cutoff logic
[PQ Sales] – Previous quarter sales with cutoff logic
[PY Sales] – Previous year sales with cutoff logic


The same can be achieve using other measures for example PY, PM, PQ see measure:
var PP = SWITCH(TRUE , 
 ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year Month]) , [PM Sales],
  ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year Quarter]) , [PQ Sales],
   ISINSCOPE('Date'[Year]) , [PY Sales]               
)

A helper like [ShowValueForDates] to prevent future-looking comparisons
The [PP Sales] measure is the same in every visual, but returns context-aware results.
