Previous Calendar Year (PYC) Sales
This measure compares current period sales against the entire previous calendar year, using PARALLELPERIOD to shift the context back one full year, regardless of shape or filter depth.

DAX Measure

PYC Sales :=
IF(
    [ShowValueForDates],
    CALCULATE(
        [Sales Amount],
        PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR)
    )
)

What It Does
PARALLELPERIOD(..., -1, YEAR) shifts the filter context back by exactly one year
It preserves the shape of the context (month, quarter, year total — whatever you're looking at)
Works well for full-year-over-year comparisons
[ShowValueForDates] ensures you're not evaluating past the last valid sales date

PARALLELPERIOD vs SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR

Function	Behavior
SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR	Keeps same shape across years (e.g., Jan 1–15 last year if Jan 1–15 is selected now)
PARALLELPERIOD	Shifts filter context back exactly one full period, regardless of visual context
DATEADD(..., -1, YEAR)	More flexible, can work with irregular periods or handle non-standard calendars

Use Case
Use this measure when:

You want calendar year over calendar year comparison
You don’t want to limit to YTD or partial months
You're showing totals in KPI cards, bar charts, or annual performance reports

Caution
PARALLELPERIOD ignores filter shape — it just shifts back one full year
So if you’re looking at YTD in the current year, it’ll pull full prior year, unless controlled
Use SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR or DATEADD if you want to keep the shape (e.g., up to today only)

Thank you :)
