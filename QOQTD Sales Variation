Quarter-over-Quarter-To-Date (QoQTD) Sales
This measure calculates the difference between current quarter-to-date sales and the previous quarter’s equivalent period, enabling clean visibility into quarterly momentum and short-term growth trends.

DAX Measure

QoQTD Sales :=
VAR current_sales_qtd = [QTD Sales]
VAR previous_sales_qtd = [PQTD Sales]
VAR result =
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_sales_qtd) && NOT ISBLANK(previous_sales_qtd),
        current_sales_qtd - previous_sales_qtd
    )
RETURN
    result

How It Works
[QTD Sales] should be based on DATESQTD with optional cutoff via [ShowValueForDates]
[PQTD Sales] must shift the date context back one quarter (typically using DATEADD(..., -1, QUARTER))
Handles BLANK() defensively to avoid noise in visual totals or incorrect comparisons

Dependencies
QTD Sales example:

QTD Sales :=
CALCULATE(
    [Sales Amount],
    DATESQTD('Date'[Date])
)

PQTD Sales:
PQTD Sales :=
VAR dates_table =
    CALCULATETABLE(
        DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, QUARTER),
        'Date'[DateWithSales] = TRUE
    )
RETURN
    IF(
        [ShowValueForDates],
        CALCULATE([QTD Sales], dates_table)
    )

This gives a true apples-to-apples delta, only comparing as far into each quarter as valid data allows.

Optional: % Growth Version

QoQTD % Growth :=
VAR current = [QTD Sales]
VAR previous = [PQTD Sales]
RETURN
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current) && NOT ISBLANK(previous),
        DIVIDE(current - previous, previous)
    )

Use Case
Executive dashboards comparing performance across quarters
KPI cards for “QoQTD Variance”
Alerts or trend charts to monitor drops or gains early in a quarter
