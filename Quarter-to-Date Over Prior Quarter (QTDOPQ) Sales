This measure compares the current quarter-to-date (QTD) sales against the total sales of the previous full quarter, helping assess how well the current quarter is shaping up.

DAX Measure

QTDOPQ Sales :=
VAR currentQuarter = [Sales QTD]
VAR fullpreviousQuarter = [PQC Sales]
VAR result =
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(currentQuarter) &&
        NOT ISBLANK(fullpreviousQuarter),
        currentQuarter - fullpreviousQuarter
    )
RETURN
    result

What It Does
[Sales QTD]  sales from the beginning of the current quarter up to today
[PQC Sales]  total sales of the entire prior quarter (not just up to a matching date)

Returns the difference to assess quarter pacing

Example Output

Date (Q3)	QTD Sales	PQC Sales (Q2)	QTDOPQ
Jul 15	$1,050,000	$2,300,000	-$1,250,000
Aug 30	$2,200,000	$2,300,000	-$100,000
Sep 30	$3,050,000	$2,300,000	$750,000

Use Cases
Mid-quarter pacing: “Are we outperforming last quarter so far?”
Visual trends with growth or slowdown indicators
Early detection of quarter-over-quarter momentum

Caveats
This is not an apples-to-apples date comparison — it’s partial vs full
Expect negative values early in the quarter — that’s normal
Don’t use for financial close unless quarter is complete
