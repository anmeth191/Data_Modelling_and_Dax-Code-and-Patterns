This measure calculates a 30-day moving average of sales, restricted to dates with actual transactions. 
It prevents inaccurate averages on incomplete periods — especially important at the beginning of your dataset.

Scenario for Understanding
Assume:
The first transaction was recorded on March 1, 2018
The current filter context date is August 1, 2025
This context is key to understanding how the virtual table behaves.

DAX Code

30_Days_Sales_AVG :=
VAR Thirty_days_period =
    // Virtual table: July 2, 2025 to August 1, 2025
    CALCULATETABLE(
        DATESINPERIOD('Date'[Date], MAX('Date'[Date]), -30, DAY),
        'Date'[DateWithSales] = TRUE
    )

VAR first_day_with_data =
    // First recorded transaction, e.g., March 1, 2018
    CALCULATE(MIN(Sales[Order Date]), REMOVEFILTERS())

VAR first_day_in_period =
    // Minimum date from the virtual table → July 2, 2025
    MINX(Thirty_days_period, 'Date'[Date])

VAR result =
    // Proceed only if dataset has data before or at the window start
    IF(
        first_day_with_data <= first_day_in_period,
        AVERAGEX(Thirty_days_period, [Sales Amount])
    )

RETURN result

Variable Breakdown
Variable	Description
Thirty_days_period	Builds a virtual table for the last 30 days (July 2 → August 1, 2025), restricted to dates with actual sales.
first_day_with_data	Retrieves the earliest order date in the dataset (e.g., March 1, 2018), ignoring filters.
first_day_in_period	Gets the start date of the 30-day window, e.g., July 2, 2025.
result	Only returns a value if the full window is within the available data history.

Example Evaluation

With MAX(Date[Date]) = August 1, 2025:
DATESINPERIOD(...) → returns July 2 to August 1, 2025
first_day_with_data → March 1, 2018
first_day_in_period → July 2, 2025
Since 2018-03-01 <= 2025-07-02, the 30-day window is valid
AVERAGEX executes across the 30-day period

Why It Matters
Avoids calculating averages on incomplete rolling windows
Reflects true 30-day performance only when full data is available
Easily extended to rolling 7, 60, or 90 days (just change the -30)

Thank you :)
