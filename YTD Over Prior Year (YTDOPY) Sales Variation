YTD Over Prior Year (YTDOPY) Sales
This DAX pattern compares the current year-to-date sales to the entire previous calendar year’s sales, providing visibility into how the current year is pacing against last year in total.

DAX Measure

YTDOPY Sales :=
VAR current_period_ytd = [Sales YTD (Using flag) Angel]
VAR previous_period = [PYC Sales]
VAR result =
    IF(
        NOT ISBLANK(current_period_ytd) &&
        NOT ISBLANK(previous_period),
        current_period_ytd - previous_period
    )
RETURN
    result

What It Does
[Sales YTD (Using flag) Angel] is your current YTD sales logic — typically using DATESYTD or a custom flag-based approach
[PYC Sales] retrieves the total from the entire prior calendar year

It compares how far the current year has come relative to last year's full total
Guards against BLANK() to avoid misleading visuals

Useful for understanding “are we on track to outperform last year?” even before the current year is complete.

Business Caveat
This is not a clean apples-to-apples unless you’re at year-end — so it's best used for:

Trend pacing visuals
Early warning signals
Strategic dashboards where "progress vs goal" matters more than strict equivalency

If you want true YTD vs YTD, use [PYTD Sales] instead:

YoYTD Sales :=
[Sales YTD] - [PYTD Sales]

Use Cases
Executive or CFO dashboards
Comparing in-year performance to last year's benchmark
Tracking run-rate vs last year in pacing visualizations

Thank you :)
